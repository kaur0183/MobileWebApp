		<h3>Love at its grandest</h3>

		<p>Veer Zaara is a story of epic proportions which shows the deepest insight into the understanding of love as it applies to the human experience. Terrors, along with joys, test the bonds of two lovers of different faiths, different nationalities, but similar feelings. These feelings reflect upon the plot so brilliantly, making this movie Shah Rukh Khan's second best performance, following behind Kal Ho Naa Ho. The Late Madan Mohan has composed brilliant songs which shed light on the journeys of the two star crossed lovers, highlighting both comical and tragic moments in this classic saga. As for Veer Zaara's influence on the public, a motif of unity, an archetype of love in the hero's garden is shared with the two nations, creating a bond forged in steel. This is something Shakespeare should have seen.</p>

		<p>It was a really spectacular movie! I think the cinematography, music, colour, acting and 'second to none' story were instrumental in it being, I am sure, one of the best of its time. "Hats off" to Chopra and his team for directing yet another masterpiece! I must have this on DVD to add to my aspiring collection of movies. I couldn't believe that the movie did not waste time, with the usual 'Tun Tun' characters, which I must say, are displayed really well sometimes. The movie progressed smoothly, from one Scene to the next backed by superb and riveting music. I saw the movie this weekend (couldn't go before due to Diwali and Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations) and will return to the cinema this coming weekend to view it yet again! I think the movie had a 'Dilwale....' kind of feeling to it linked, perhaps, to the rural, peasant farming, outdoor field type of setting. I was truly pleased to see a movie linked to the India/Pakistan conflict, to be devoid of fighting and bloodshed! The movie addressed some of the more delicate issues of this conflict and must say that it was done in the most professional way!....Great movie....I give it five(5) stars</p>
